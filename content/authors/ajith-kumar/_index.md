Passionate Software Craftsperson with deep expertise in Ruby on Rails and a growing appreciation for React in a more sensible, performance-focused way. Always exploring new ways to write cleaner, more efficient code and build robust applications.

Loves sharing knowledge through technical writing and helping developers build better applications. When not coding, you'll find me diving deep into Rails internals, performance optimization techniques, tending to my garden, working on aquascaping, or watching anime. 🌱🐠📺
