The "Standup meeting" or "Daily Scrum" that everyone does religiously just for sake of calling themselves "Agile".

Name does not matter, you can call it anything, I like to call it "Huddle".

### Intent

If we look at the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), it does not describe how to manage your project,
however there are two methodologies comes to our mind,
1 [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) which is the most popular and the "Daily Scrum"
comes from that, and 2. [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) which is considered to
be the best explanation of Agile.

While "Standup meeting", "Daily Sync meeting", "Daily Scrum", "Any other" have different definitions, we should focus on
the meeting from the Agile perspective instead of religiously following process each one's process and definition.

Over the years as "regular" project managers converted to Agile way, the Agile lost its core value, and so did standup
meeting. Agile became just another name of older project management process.

### Values

If we look at Agile values, it focuses on "Interactions", "Collaboration", "Delivery", and "Change".
Remember these while creating your own rules of Standup meeting.

### FAQ

##### Q: What is ideal frequency?

Usually every day. However, if you are "Interacting" frequently and does need know the status then you can meet less.

##### Q: Where?

Anywhere the whole team is comfortable. Physical or Remote. Does not matter.

##### Q: When?

Ideally at the start of the day. However, if everyone is not available or working remote in different geography then you
can do at any time.

##### Q: What content?

- What did I do since the last meeting?
- What will I do until the next meeting?
- Challenges

##### Q: How granular?

Remember, it is for the team. So, your updates should be abstract enough that everyone can understand and contribute to
the project goal.

##### Q: Duration?

Ideally 15 minutes max. Every team member should speak for only 2 or 3 minutes. If you think that there are too many
participants and not everyone can finish in 15 minutes then it is a different problem. Ideally you should divide the
team instead of shortening individual's time or increasing standup meetings time.

##### Q: Should I be standing up?

Well, the meeting should be short. So, psychologically, if you are standing up then you would be quick. So, if your
standups are not ending in time, then you should start standing up for sure.

##### Q: Should we hire scrum master?

If you are married to the process of Scrum, then sure. But, if your focus is on Agile values then you don't need to.

However, if you observe that the team is not doing what they need to do or doing what they shouldn't be doing, then
scrum master can help streamline that. Also, in this case, don't make the scrum master be your process.

##### Q: What should be scrum master's role?

They teach the team to follow the practice and create other scrum masters. Remember, scrum master is not a permanent
process. It is just an initial push. These are just the people who know how to effectively conduct the meeting.

##### Q: What is facilitator?

After the scum master left the team, one person from the team take up the role of facilitator. Almost like scrum master.
They initiate and make sure smooth exchange of baton. Don't make a single person facilitator, always change them.

You don't even need facilitator if you think your team is mature enough to handle things.

##### Q: What order?

Choose whatever suites you.

Some like the alphabetical order, some like the current position they are sitting, some like facilitator assigning, some
like the last person nominating the next person.

You can be creative as soon as meetings are short and effective.

##### Q: Do I need burn down chart? Or any chart?

That is a great way to visualize the status. However, status is not the goal, action item is the goal.
Anything that helps the project.
It helps identify whether you need to organize yourself and the team in a better way.

Other way is to have just sticky notes or cards in a dashboard. Identify how many cards should have been moved and
current status.

Any tool that publishes data is good enough.

Many teams don't even use any!

### What not to do

##### Too granular

"I worked on the order class and implemented that method", "I worked on liquibase scripts", nobody cares and should care
about that. Make it abstract
enough as if non devs should understand it as well. The meeting is for project, not yourself. Don't go too technical.

Focus on the task or stories completeness or challenge.

This is one of the reasons the meeting becomes boring. Because nobody understands what other person really means, and
then they stop giving attention to the other person.

##### Cutting each other

Only one person speaks!

This is one of the reason why the meeting does not end in designated time and last for even hour!

##### Everyone addressing to one person

The meeting is not project status report meeting! It is a sync up call. Everyone should address the team, not the team
lead or project manager.

Either non devs or attendee who is not directly working with the team should be quite or give their updates to everyone
like any other person but never be receiver.

##### Slip in other thing.

"Let me show the demo of what I did", "Hey, if you are facing this issue then do this to solve it", "Why don't you do
this?", "Why don't we do this?". None of this should happen. Everyone should focus on only strictly updates. Nothing
else.

Did I say nothing else?

If you want to have other conversation, meet after the meeting and have separate meeting with smaller group. Even if the
next meeting is going to be the same participants, don't do it now, call other meet and do it separately.

##### Too many update

"I worked on setting up that server then talked to Bob then talked to Yoda about order detail then talked to Groot about
invoice preparation" - How does this help the project? Why anyone should care?

##### Too much project specific

"I worked on ABC-549 and ABC-588 and will keep working on that". While this looks like good enough. However, not
everyone would have context on what "ABC-549" is, instead of that try to say "I worked on order detail screen".

### Honorary addition

Lately, some teams have started introducing non project related and team related talk in the meeting.
Those are not bad. Those helps team building. Some of the examples are as following,

- How was your weekend?
- What did you learn recently?
- What books are you reading?
- How are you feeling?
- Do you want to thank anyone?
