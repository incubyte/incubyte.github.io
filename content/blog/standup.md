The "Standup meeting" or "Daily Scrum" that everyone does religiously just for the sake of calling themselves "Agile."

The name does not matter; you can call it anything. I like to call it “Huddle.”

### Intent

If we look at the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), it does not describe how to manage your project,
however, there are two methodologies that comes to our mind:
1 [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), which is the most popular; The "Daily Scrum"
comes from that, and 2. [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) which is considered to
be the best explanation of Agile.

While “Standup meeting,” “Daily Sync meeting,” “Daily Scrum,” and “Any other” have different definitions, we should
focus on the meeting from the Agile perspective instead of religiously following process each one’s process and
definition.

Over the years, as “regular” project managers converted to the Agile way, Agile lost its core value, and so did standup
meetings. Agile became just another name for the older project management process.

### Values

If we look at Agile values, it focuses on “Interactions,” “Collaboration,” “Delivery,” and “Change.” Remember these
while creating your own rules for Standup meetings.

### FAQ

##### Q: What is the ideal frequency?

Usually, every day. However, if you are “Interacting” frequently and do not need to know the status, then you can meet
less.

##### Q: Where?

Anywhere the whole team is comfortable. Physical or Remote. Does not matter.

##### Q: When?

Ideally at the start of the day. However, if everyone is not available or working remotely in different geographies, you
can do it anytime.

##### Q: What content?

- What did I do since the last meeting?
- What will I do until the next meeting?
- Challenges

##### Q: How granular?

Remember, it is for the team. Your updates should be abstract enough that everyone can understand and contribute to
the project goal.

##### Q: Duration?

Ideally, 15 minutes max. Every team member should speak for only 2 or 3 minutes. If there are too many
participants and not everyone can finish in 15 minutes, then it is a different problem. Ideally, divide the
team instead of shortening individuals' time or increasing standup meetings' time.

##### Q: Should I be standing up?

Well, the meeting should be short. So, psychologically, if you are standing up, you would be quick. So, if your standups
are not ending in time, you should definitely start standing up.

##### Q: Should we hire a scrum master?

If you are married to the process of Scrum, then sure. But, if your focus is on Agile values, you don't need to.

However, if you observe that the team is not doing what they need to do or doing what they shouldn't be doing, then
scrum master can help streamline that. Also, in this case, don't make the scrum master your process.

##### Q: What should be the scrum master's role?

They teach the team to follow the practice and create other scrum masters. Remember, scrum master is not a permanent
process. It is just an initial push. These are just the people who know how to conduct the meeting effectively.

##### Q: What is a facilitator?

After the scum master left the team, one person from the team takes up the role of facilitator,
almost like a scrum master.
They initiate and make sure of a smooth exchange of baton. Don't make a single person facilitator; always rotate them.

You don't need a facilitator if you think your team is mature enough to handle things.

##### Q: What order?

Choose whatever suits you.

Some like the alphabetical order, some like the current position they are sitting in, some like facilitator assigning,
some like the last person nominating the next person.

You can be creative as soon as meetings are short and effective.

##### Q: Do I need a burn down chart? Or any chart?

That is a great way to visualize the status. However, status is not the goal; action item is the goal.
Anything that helps the project.
It helps identify whether you need to organize yourself and the team better.

Another way is to have just sticky notes or cards in a dashboard. Identify how many cards should have been moved and
current status.

Any tool that publishes data is good enough.

Many teams don't even use any!

### What not to do

##### Too granular

"I worked on the order class and implemented that method", "I worked on liquibase scripts", nobody cares and should care
about that. Make it abstract enough as if the recipients are non devs.
The meeting is for the project, not yourself. Don't go too technical.

Focus on the task or story's completeness or challenge.

This is one of the reasons the meeting becomes boring.
Because nobody understands what the other person really means, and then they stop paying attention to the other person.

##### Cutting each other

Only one person speaks!

This is one reason why the meeting continues after the designated time and lasts for even an hour!

##### Everyone addressing to one person

The meeting is not a project status report meeting! It is a sync up call. Everyone should address the team, not the team
lead or project manager.

Non devs or attendees who are not directly working with the team should be quiet or give their updates to
everyone like any other person but never be a receiver.

##### Slip in other thing.

"Let me show the demo of what I did", "Hey, if you are facing this issue, then do this to solve it", "Why don't you do
this?", "Why don't we do this?". None of this should happen. Everyone should focus on only strictly updates. Nothing
else.

Did I say nothing else?

If you want another conversation, meet after the meeting and have a separate meeting with a smaller group.
Even if the next meeting will have the same participants, don't do it now; call another meeting and do it separately.

##### Too many update

"I worked on setting up that server then talked to Bob then talked to Yoda about order detail then talked to Groot about
invoice preparation" - How does this help the project? Why should anyone care?

##### Too much project specific

"I worked on ABC-549 and ABC-588 and will keep working on that". While this looks like good enough. However, not
everyone would have context on what "ABC-549" is; instead, try to say, "I worked on order detail screen".

### Honorary addition

Lately, some teams have started introducing non project related and team related talks in the meeting.
Those are not bad. Those help team building. Some of the examples are as follows,

- How was your weekend?
- What did you learn recently?
- What books are you reading?
- How are you feeling?
- Do you want to thank anyone?
