The "Standup meeting" or "Daily Scrum" that everyone does religiously just for the sake of calling themselves "Agile."

The name does not matter; you can call it anything. I like to call it “Huddle.”

### Intent

If we look at the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), it does not describe how to manage your project,
however, there are two methodologies that comes to our mind:

1. [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), which is the most popular; The "Daily Scrum" comes from that.
2. [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) which is considered to be the best explanation of Agile.

While “Standup meeting,” “Daily Sync meeting,” “Daily Scrum,” and any other name have different definitions, we should
focus on the meeting from the Agile perspective instead of religiously following each one’s process and definition.

Over the years, as “regular” project managers converted to the Agile way, Agile lost its core value, and so did standup
meetings. Agile became just another name for the older project management process.

### Values

If we look at Agile values, it focuses on “Interactions,” “Collaboration,” “Delivery,” and “Change.” Remember these
while creating your own rules for standup meetings.

### FAQ

##### Q: What is the ideal frequency?

Usually, every day. However, if you are “Interacting” frequently and do not need to know the status, then you can meet less.

##### Q: Where?

Anywhere the whole team is comfortable. Physical or Remote. Does not matter.

If you are conducting it remotely, always have videos on.
You want to talk to humans, not animated figures!

##### Q: When?

Ideally at the start of the day. However, if everyone is not available or working remotely in different geographies, you
can do it anytime.

##### Q: What content?

- What did I do since the last meeting?
- What will I do until the next meeting?
- Challenges

##### Q: How granular?

Remember, it is for the team. Your updates should be abstract enough that everyone can understand and contribute to the project goal.

##### Q: Duration?

Ideally, 15 minutes max. Every team member should speak for only 2 or 3 minutes. If there are too many
participants and not everyone can finish in 15 minutes, then it is a different problem. Ideally, divide the
team instead of shortening individuals' time or increasing standup meetings' time.

##### Q: Should I be standing up?

Well, the meeting should be short. So, psychologically, if you are standing up, you would be quick. So, if your standups
are not ending in time, you should definitely start standing up.

##### Q: Should we hire a scrum master?

If you are married to the process of Scrum, then sure. But, if your focus is on Agile values, you don't need to.

I disagree with the concept of having a Scrum master. The word master is terrible anyway. 
It also brings all the micromanagement, like tracking the burndown chart like a hawk, and certifications like CSM.

We should rename that to Agile mentor/coach, even if we want someone to teach Agile principles.

##### Q: Should we hire an Agile coach/mentor?

If you observe that the team is not doing what they need to do or doing what they shouldn't be doing, then
an Agile coach can help streamline that. Also, in this case, don't make the Agile coach your process.

##### Q: What should be the Agile coach's role?

They teach the team to follow the practice and create other Agile coaches.
Remember, Agile coaching is not a permanent process.
It is just an initial push.
These are just the people who know how to conduct the meeting effectively.

##### Q: What is a facilitator?

After the Agile coach/mentor leaves the team, one person from the team takes up the role of facilitator,
almost like an Agile coach/mentor but internal.
They initiate and make sure of a smooth exchange of baton. Don't make a single person facilitator; always rotate them.

You don't need a facilitator if you think your team is mature enough to handle things.

##### Q: What order?

Choose whatever suits you.

Some like the alphabetical order, some like the current position they are sitting in, some like facilitator assigning,
some like the last person nominating the next person.

You can be creative as soon as meetings are short and effective.

##### Q: Do I need a burn down chart? Or any chart? any board?

That is a great way to visualize the status. However, status is not the goal; action item is the goal.
Anything that helps the project.
It helps identify whether you need to organize yourself and the team better.

Another way is to have just sticky notes or cards in a dashboard.
Identify how many cards should have been moved and current status.

Any tool that publishes data is good enough.

Many teams don't even use any! (These are very mature teams. I would recommend having some visual representation.)

### What not to do

##### Too granular

"I worked on the order class and implemented that method", "I worked on liquibase scripts", nobody cares and should care about that.
Make it abstract enough as if the recipients are non devs.
The meeting is for the project, not yourself. Don't go too technical.

Focus on the task or story's completeness or challenge.

This is one of the reasons the meeting becomes boring.
Because nobody understands what the other person really means, and then they stop paying attention to the other person.

##### Cutting each other

Only one person speaks!

This is one reason why the meeting continues after the designated time and lasts for even an hour!

##### Everyone addressing to one person

The meeting is not a project status report meeting! It is a sync up call.
Everyone should address the team, not the team lead or project manager.

Non devs or attendees who are not directly working with the team should be quiet or give their updates to
everyone like any other person but never be a receiver.

##### Slip in other thing.

"Let me show the demo of what I did", "Hey, if you are facing this issue, then do this to solve it", "Why don't you do
this?", "Why don't we do this?".
None of this should happen. Everyone should focus on only strictly updates. Nothing else.

Did I say nothing else?

If you want another conversation, meet after the meeting and have a separate meeting with a smaller group.
Even if the next meeting will have the same participants, don't do it now; call another meeting and do it separately.

##### Q: But we work only remotely, and this is the only time the whole team is together; I would want it to last a little longer and combine other things.

Even in that case, keep the standup time shorter. Be on the same call with the same people, just complete standup in a short time.
Don't slip in a demo along with standup. Do other things after officially concluding standup. Wear a different hat after that. 

Remember, the standup should be completed on time in a short duration. 
The meeting or call can be extended with the same or different participants.

##### Too many update

"I worked on setting up that server then talked to Bob then talked to Yoda about order detail then talked to Groot about
invoice preparation" — How does this help the project? Why should anyone care?

##### Absence of context

"I worked on ABC-549 and ABC-588 and will keep working on that". While this looks like good enough. However, not
everyone would have context on what "ABC-549" is; instead, try to say, "I worked on order detail screen".

##### Not using burndown chart or team board because it is not updated

If you have some other way you can get the project status then it is okay to not have a board.
However, having incorrect status for tasks/stories is not a good reason not to have a board.

Always keep your tasks/stories updated with the latest status as soon as you make progress. 
Don't wait for standup to update those.

It is always better to have some visual representation than not having any.

##### Sticking to one process

Don't make your standups boring. 

Standup is a practice, and its effectiveness must be questioned, and ways of improving must be part of retro discussions.

### Honorary addition

Lately, some teams have started introducing non project related and team related talks in the meeting.
Those are not bad. Those help team building. Some examples are as follows,

- How was your weekend?
- What did you learn recently?
- What books are you reading?
- How are you feeling?
- Do you want to thank anyone?
- Anything you are excited about this week?
