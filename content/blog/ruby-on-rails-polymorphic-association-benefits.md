In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, optimizing database design and ensuring efficient data management are crucial aspects.
Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework, provides a powerful feature known as polymorphic association, which offers a myriad of benefits for developers.

In this blog post, we'll explore the advantages of leveraging polymorphic association in Ruby on Rails.

## 1. Storage Saving

One of the key advantages of using polymorphic association is the efficient use of storage.
Unlike traditional methods where blank columns might be created for existing records, polymorphic association allows data to be added to a dedicated table, avoiding the creation of unnecessary columns.

This not only saves storage space but also ensures a cleaner and more organized database structure.

## 2. Architectural Separation

Polymorphic association enables architectural separation by allowing developers to track specific functionality in a different table without impacting the main table responsible for holding core data.

This separation proves invaluable when dealing with functionalities that sync with other systems.
Developers can create similar tables for different sync functionalities, maintaining a clear and modular architectural design.

## 3. Flexibility

Flexibility is a hallmark of polymorphic association.
With a dedicated table for a specific functionality, such as tracking errors, developers have the freedom to add more columns like `last_error`, `error_code`, and others without impacting the main table.

This flexibility ensures that the database schema can adapt to changing requirements without the need for extensive modifications.

## 4. Better Indexing

Maintaining optimal performance is crucial for any application, and polymorphic association aids in achieving better indexing.
Adding numerous indexes to a single table can lead to performance degradation.

By separating functionality into dedicated tables, developers can create indexes tailored to specific needs without impacting the performance of the main table.
This approach contributes to a more efficient and responsive application.

## 5. Easy Attachability

Enabling functionality for multiple models becomes a seamless process with polymorphic association.
In our example, where functionality is enabled for three models, additional models can adopt the same functionality without requiring any database changes.

Simply including the relevant module in the specific model is all that's needed, providing a hassle-free approach to extending functionality across different parts of the application.

## 6. Avoiding Code Duplication

The ease of attaching functionality to different models not only simplifies the development process but also helps in avoiding code duplication.

As mentioned in point number 5, incorporating a module for a specific functionality ensures that the same codebase can be reused across various models, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Illustrating Polymorphic Association with AWS Synchronization

Let's integrate a real-world example of polymorphic association for tracking AWS synchronization for two distinct models: `Patient` and `Doctor`.

```ruby
# app/models/aws_sync_status.rb
class AwsSyncStatus < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :parent, polymorphic: true
end

# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: aws_sync_statuses
#
#  id           :uuid             not null, primary key
#  parent_type  :string           not null
#  synced_at    :datetime
#  triggered_at :datetime         not null
#  created_at   :datetime         not null
#  updated_at   :datetime         not null
#  parent_id    :uuid             not null
#
# Indexes
#
#  index_aws_sync_statuses_on_parent  (parent_type,parent_id)
#

# app/models/concerns/aws/sync_track.rb
module Aws::SyncTrack
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_one :aws_sync_status, as: :parent, dependent: :destroy
    delegate :synced_at, to: :aws_sync_status, prefix: :aws, allow_nil: true
  end

  def synced_with_aws_at
    return nil if aws_record_id.blank?
    aws_synced_at || created_at
  end

  def create_or_update_aws_sync_status(aws_sync_attrs)
    aws_sync_status.blank? ? create_aws_sync_status(aws_sync_attrs) : aws_sync_status.update(aws_sync_attrs)
  end
end

# app/models/patient.rb
class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  include Aws::SyncTrack
end

# app/models/doctor.rb
class Doctor < ApplicationRecord
  include Aws::SyncTrack
end
```

In this example, we've implemented a polymorphic association using the AwsSyncStatus model.
The Aws::SyncTrack concern is included in both the Patient and Doctor models, providing them with AWS synchronization tracking capabilities.

This modularity allows for easy attachment of the AWS synchronization functionality to multiple models without the need for extensive database modifications.

By utilizing polymorphic associations in this manner, developers can seamlessly extend functionality across various models, promoting a clean and modular approach to application development.

## Conclusion

Polymorphic association in Ruby on Rails emerges as a valuable tool for database management and application architecture.
From storage savings and architectural separation to flexibility and better indexing, the benefits of adopting polymorphic association are diverse and impactful.

By incorporating this feature into your Rails projects, you can enhance both the efficiency and maintainability of your application's database design.
The real-world example of AWS synchronization illustrates how polymorphic association facilitates the easy integration of specific functionalities across different models, showcasing the power and flexibility it brings to web development.
