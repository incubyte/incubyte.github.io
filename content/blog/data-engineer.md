## Interview Process

Our interview process will help us to understand your breadth and depth of expertise. We all carry different skills and areas of expertise, and encourage people at all stages of their journeys to apply. Depending on your availability, the entire process can take as little as 2 days.

1. Coding test: You will take an online coding test and submit your repo to Git following a set of simple instructions
2. Initial call: Usually a 30-minute call with our recruitment team where we’ll get to know each other and to see what values we have in common. At this stage, we’re more interested in your mindset and any values or principles that are important to you.
3. Technical Test: A technical/functional conversation with one of our Craftspeople. You will go into more depth regarding your technical skills and interests. This is a great opportunity to ask questions.
4. Pair Programming/Live coding: A remote pair programming session with your choice of IDE and tooling up to you. We’ll tackle a coding kata together, with more focus on your coding and software design skills. Look at it as a chance to showcase your skills.
5. Final interview: A call with the founders to determine alignment in attitude and work philosophy
