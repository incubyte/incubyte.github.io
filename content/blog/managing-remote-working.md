Born in the Covid-19 era, we are a sappling in a hailstorm. Having been remote since day-1 we can honestly say that there are two sides to the coin.

The biggest pro to being totally remote helps us hire talent irrespective of their geographical location and this lets us access the perfect people who have the right tech skills as well as the cultural core values that we hold oh so dear.
