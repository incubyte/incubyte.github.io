**"How long will the project completion take?"** is a question that has been on our mind at some stage in our careers. Even pondering over an accurate answer for this can make one shudder. Estimating software development time is a lengthy and complicated process and is not as straightforward. The procedure needs knowledge and years of expertise on hand, and it involves potential pitfalls that can mess up the entire plan.

The purpose of this article is to analyze the highs and lows of traditional time estimates and discuss alternatives that might help!

## In a parallel world of perfect planning

How amazing would it be if everything went as per the plan. Unfortunately, that’s (usually) never the case.

When asked about her experience with time estimation, Sameera, developer at Incubyte said, "Even after strategic planning and description of the project flow, the estimates didn't come out satisfactorily, and the entire project had to be scraped out, and we had to start from scratch." It was a complete waste of time and other resources involved.

Estimates vary in planning and reality. There is always a 50/50 chance that everything will go seamlessly well, or utterly wrong.

To learn what to do. We must learn what not to do! So let us look at some factors that can deviate your estimation.

### Development is a step-by-step process

Working on new assignments is not merely about coding, you may also be required to conduct research, collaborate with other developers, and attend meetings relating to the task. Usually, time estimates do not consider all the extra time that goes into a large project, which can be as much as twice your original estimate.

### Planning

### _“Perfect plans are perfectly stupid” - Dave Farley_

Prior to starting any project, having a technical plan or feasibility study in place can go a long way. Having a plan is an excellent starting point when estimating time. This is where you can inform all the stakeholders involved what you are planning and ask for feedback. As you go through all the intricacies, you will see that your estimate is gradually improving while you find new variables. However, it always takes longer than you estimate. While having a plan certainly helps, it is never enough to perfectly predict time involved.

### Error Bounds

Long term planning is bounded to real-time errors. And if a real-time change occurs, it creates a conflict between planned and agreed time and execution time. Entertaining new changes that clash with the plan can extend the period of the entire development process. And one cannot ignore these changes, however, working on them can consume a lot of the company’s time and resources involved. This can be a dilemma for both software developers as well as the respective company.

### Estimation is not impossible. It is inaccurate.

Due to a variety of problems involved, time estimates for software development are frequently inaccurate, leading to missed expectations and dissatisfaction for stakeholders. Setting objective timelines and progress tracking can undoubtedly be useful in many cases. The trick is to execute it in a way that minimizes team impact improves estimation accuracy, and meets expectations.

## To estimate or not to estimate is the question

_“An estimate is not a number. An estimate is a distribution.”_

Robert C. Martin | The Clean Coder

Assume Google Maps estimates a travel time of 40 minutes to your office. However, you encounter unexpected traffic along the route and arrive 10 minutes late. Although Google Maps critically analyzes the route conditions, the real-time scenario quite often wanders away from it. Analyzing all the elements of traditional time estimation, we are stuck with the question as to estimate or not to estimate?

Well, to answer that for you, the products that have been designed and built in the last five to six years have dramatically changed the entire development process. It is a journey from waterfall to an agile mindset. The estimation is not just limited to quantifying the distance between two points, it is being able to anticipating the last-minute chaos along the way and preparing accordingly.

As a result, estimating is a terrific way to determine the speed at which you should work, but it cannot be completely relied upon. You need to maintain your peace with any real-time errors or delays that may arise while working on a project.

## Agile is a way to go

There is no silver bullet when it comes to estimation. Projects are usually designed with time limitations in mind. Estimations should not be made for large requirements. A project can be subdivided into relevant small tasks and then estimations for these small tasks should be implemented. The project can then be divided into specific goals and manageable parts that can be handled in shorter time intervals.

The agile technique keeps your chaos under control. Agile mechanism helps you measure the job difficulty rather than quantifying the time of completion.

**Agile practices and a product-focused mindset is a way to go and will add maximum value to end-users, thus keeping all the stakeholders happy.**
