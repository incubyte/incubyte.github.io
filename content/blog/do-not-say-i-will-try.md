Uncle Bob says this very well in his book Clean Coder. And I will try it too! In the world of SoWs, contracts, and deadlines, one of the most common phrases software developers end up saying is "I will try"!

When a developer says this, he may mean, "I will try, and I may not be able to deliver." However, it gets perceived as a promise of timely delivery. This behavior is one of the pitfalls of being a developer. Accepting the deadline before knowing the details of what has to be done and saying, "I will try." As a developer, you should strive to become aware of what you will need to complete a task before making promises of when you will deliver it.
