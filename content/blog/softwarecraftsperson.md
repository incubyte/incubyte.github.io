+++

Weâ€™re looking to hire software craftspeople, who believe in and are evangelists of extreme programming principles and who have a real thirst for learning and up-skilling themselves. High quality, motivated and passionate people who make great teams. We heavily believe in being a DevOps organization, where developers own the entire release cycle and thus get to work not only on programming languages, but also on infrastructure technologies in the cloud.

Coding

- Test Driven Development is second nature during the coding lifecycle.
- Good design principles, such as SOLID, while we develop software, however as our experience grows, we look wider and go to first principles such as simplicity, coupling and cohesion to a point where we have an intuitive understanding.
- We love to pair program and see it as an opportunity to learn from each other.
- We take an active interest in subjects like Domain Driven Design, Architectural Patterns, Security and other more holistic characteristics of the software product.

Automation & Operations

- We aspire to become skilled in crafting effective continuous delivery pipelines and systems that are easy to operate in production.
- We aspire to a DevOps culture. Most of us are skilled, to a good level, on the coding side and consider infrastructure as code as an important skillset.
- We enjoy working with cloud offerings such as Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
- We find technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Puppet, etc to be extremely valuable to achieving effective delivery pipelines and reliable platforms.
- Whilst we refrain from over engineering, we also aspire to use modern technologies to increase the efficiency, productivity and reliability of our software development process and eventually our software product
