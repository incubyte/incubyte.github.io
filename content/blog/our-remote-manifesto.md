Born in the Covid-19 era, we were a sappling in a hailstorm, but we came out on the other side - Stronger, Tougher and Smarter. Having been remote since day-1 we can honestly say that though majority people believe that there two sides to the remote coin, we are behind remote working 100%

The biggest pro to being totally remote helps us hire talent irrespective of their geographical location by letting us access the perfect people who have the right tech skills as well as the cultural core values that we hold oh so dear.

The other major advantage apart from cost saving on office space, is that it offers so much more flexibility in employees daily lives and gives them power over their own time and schedules, we believe this is empowering for our employees. A number of studies from the likes of [Google](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2019/05/18/5-important-takeaways-from-googles-two-year-study-of-remote-work/#1a536957439a), [Buffer](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019), [FlexJobs](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-remote-work-has-grown-by-159-since-2005/), and [IWG](http://assets.regus.com/pdfs/iwg-workplace-survey/iwg-workplace-survey-2019.pdf) show that driven individuals who place a high degree of value on autonomy and flexibility can experience new levels of joy and productivity in an all-remote environment.

It’s important for employees to truly take advantage of the freedoms and possibilities enabled by remote, rather than simply remaining where they are and switching an office desk for a room in their home. This is the core benefit of \***\*remote\*\***as compared to \***\*work-from-home\*\***.

In the home, aim to create a dedicated working space (or work from a coworking space, external office, or cafe). It’s vital to intentionally separate work and life to prevent [burnout](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/). Moreover, don’t stop engaging with people. You may not fill your social quota entirely from work interactions, which enables you to pay closer attention to family, neighbors, and community opportunities.

Be intentional about replacing your recovered commute time. Whether it’s fitness, cooking, cleaning, spending time with family, or resting, be deliberate about reclaiming that time and using it to improve your overall wellbeing.
