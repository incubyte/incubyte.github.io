Early in a project, we have to decide which platforms we'll use. Which platforms depend on our ideas for solving the users' problems. After considering what's best for users, the best tools for us have a strong community, make us happy, and help us create and iterate quickly. Our developers are highly versatile with their choice of tools and integrate the tools' ideologies into their development process.Some of the tools we use and platforms we work with (and highly recommend) are/Some of the ideologies that our choice of tech platforms abide by are:

- Having an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** that supplements the developers' ability to achieve maximum efficiency. This can be achieved in many ways. Some people are vim pros and emacs hackers, some are into a full-blow IDE experience like IntelliJ, while some just prefer a no-nonsense VS Code/Atom setup.
- A **Build tool** and Scripting for automating a lot of the grunt work that developers would have to do daily â€“ hence leading to the effective utilization of time and resources. At Incubyte we start our projects with walking skeleton pattern, where we focus on fully automated CI/CD from the very early stage of the SDLC.
- A **Code Linter** ensures that the utmost quality of code is being used in the product. It also helps our team identify security issues early on in the process.
- In today's **Cloud Services** era, many pre-packaged or off-the-shelf utilities are available for our teams to use in the DevOps process. Using cloud providers, we ensure that our teams are engaged in solving the clients business problems and have a focus on the delivery of the actual application rather than focusing on maintaining servers i.e. not solving an already solved problem.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment help us achieve our primary process goal of making frequent, small releases by enforcing automation in building, testing, and deploying applications. **CI/CD** also helps bridge the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation. Modern-day DevOps practices involve continuous development, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring of software applications throughout its development life cycle. The CI/CD practice or CI/CD pipeline forms the backbone of our modern-day DevOps operations.

## Business Economics

Having talked about the platforms we use, we acknowledge that software developed with the best architecture is a failed product if it does not recognize the economic risks and the clients' market positioning. We understand this principle and are aligned with our clients' specific needs. Our teams strive to deliver continuous value, meet the business goal, and keep our clients' best interests at heart while providing the best quality technologies suited to their specific needs.

Our teams understand that a dollar earned today is better than a dollar earned tomorrow. Paired with Incremental Design and DevOps practices, our teams try to help clients make money sooner than later!
