Our Journey with LLM Evaluation Frameworks: From Eval.ai to a DeepEval-LangSmith Hybrid Approach

_\"What gets measured gets improved.\" - Peter Drucker_

{{< figure src="/images/2025/eval-testing/llm-journey.jpg" >}}

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs),
ensuring the quality and reliability of model outputs isn't just good
practice-it's essential. As our team embarked on building
production-grade LLM applications, we quickly realized that robust
evaluation frameworks would make the difference between mediocre and
exceptional AI experiences.

This blog post chronicles our evaluation journey---from our initial
steps with Eval.ai through our transition to DeepEval, and finally to
our current hybrid approach combining DeepEval's synthetic data
generation capabilities with LangSmith's comprehensive observability.

## The Challenge: Evaluating LLM Outputs at Scale

Before diving into the tools, let's frame the challenge we faced.
Evaluating LLM outputs differs significantly from traditional software
testing because:

1.  **Correctness is often subjective** --- What makes a response
    \"good\" can vary based on context

2.  **Outputs are non-deterministic** --- The same prompt can yield
    different responses

3.  **Multidimensional quality** --- Responses need to be evaluated
    across dimensions like relevance, factuality, helpfulness, and
    safety

4.  **Testing at production scale** --- Manual evaluation quickly
    becomes unsustainable

## Our Initial Approach: Eval.ai

We started our evaluation journey with [Eval.ai](https://eval.ai/), a
platform designed primarily for ML researchers and competition
organizers.

### What We Liked About Eval.ai

- **Well-established platform** with support for both automatic and
  human evaluations

- **Leaderboard functionality** for comparing different model variants

- **Support for multimodal evaluation**

### The Limitations We Encountered

- **Too many manual tasks** required for routine testing

- **Primarily designed for academic challenges** rather than
  production deployment

- **Limited integration options** with our existing **TypeScript**
  codebase

- **Not optimized for LLM-specific evaluation metrics** such as
  hallucination detection

After several sprints of struggling with these limitations, we knew we
needed a more specialized solution for LLM evaluation.

## Discovering DeepEval: LLM-Specific Testing

Our search led us to [DeepEval](https://www.deepeval.com/), a framework
specifically built for evaluating generative AI outputs with a focus on
semantic quality and factuality.

### What Drew Us to DeepEval

DeepEval offered specialized metrics that aligned perfectly with our RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation:

#### RAG-Specific Metrics

- **Answer Relevancy**: How well does the response address the query?

- **Faithfulness**: Does the response stick to the facts in the
  provided context?

- **Contextual Relevancy**: Is the retrieved context relevant to the
  query?

- **Contextual Precision & Recall**: How precise and comprehensive is
  the context selection?

#### Chatbot Metrics

- **Conversational G-Eval**: Overall quality of conversational
  responses

- **Knowledge Retention**: Ability to maintain context across a
  conversation

- **Role Adherence**: Consistency with defined persona or role

- **Conversation Completeness & Relevancy**: How thoroughly and
  relevantly queries are addressed

#### **Agent Metrics**

- **Tool Correctness**: Proper use of available tools

- **Task Completion**: Success in accomplishing requested tasks

### The DeepEval Workflow

DeepEval implements test cases representing atomic interactions with
your LLM application, scored using various LLM-as-a-judge techniques:

- **QAG (Question-Answer Generation)**

- **DAG (Deep Acyclic Graphs)**

- **G-Eval methodologies**

{{< figure src="/images/2025/eval-testing/deepeval-code.jpg" >}}

**The TypeScript Challenge**

DeepEval proved to be an excellent evaluation framework, but we faced
one significant challenge: our production system was built in
TypeScript, while DeepEval is Python-based. This language mismatch led
us to explore a hybrid approach.

**Our Hybrid Solution: DeepEval + LangSmith**

Rather than completely switching frameworks again, we developed a hybrid
approach leveraging the strengths of both DeepEval and LangSmith.

{{< figure src="/images/2025/eval-testing/hybridflow.jpg" >}}

### How Our Hybrid Approach Works:

1.  **Use DeepEval for synthetic data generation**

    a. Leverage DeepEval\'s capabilities to generate diverse,
    high-quality test cases

    b. Create \"golden datasets\" of input-context-expected output
    triplets

2.  **Implement testing and monitoring in LangSmith**

    a. Feed synthetic data into LangSmith for continuous evaluation

    b. Track model performance and quality metrics in production

3.  **Maintain a feedback loop**

    a. Identify failure modes in LangSmith

    b. Generate new synthetic test cases with DeepEval targeting those
    failure modes

### LangSmith Benefits in Our Hybrid Approach

LangSmith brings several advantages to our hybrid evaluation system:

| **Feature**            | **Benefit**                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full LLMOps Lifecycle  | Combines evaluation, observability, and dataset management |
| Tracing                | Captures full traces of LLM chains and intermediate steps  |
| Production Integration | Monitors live traffic with minimal overhead                |
| Dataset Management     | Organizes examples for evaluation and fine-tuning          |
| TypeScript SDK         | Seamless integration with our existing codebase            |

## Results and Insights

After implementing our hybrid approach, we observed several significant
improvements:

{{< figure src="/images/2025/eval-testing/llm-comp-chart.jpg" >}}

1.  **Testing Coverage**: 4x increase in test coverage across different
    query types

2.  **Evaluation Speed**: 70% reduction in time needed to evaluate new
    model versions

3.  **Issue Detection**: Identified subtle hallucination patterns that
    went undetected with manual testing

4.  **Production Monitoring**: Real-time alerts when metric thresholds
    are breached

## Lessons Learned

Our journey through these evaluation frameworks taught us several
valuable lessons:

1.  **Match the framework to your tech stack**: The language your
    evaluation framework uses should align with your production
    codebase.

2.  **Synthetic data is invaluable**: Generating diverse, realistic test
    cases is essential for comprehensive evaluation.

3.  **Combine offline and online evaluation**: Pre-deployment testing
    and production monitoring are both necessary.

4.  **Domain-specific metrics matter**: Generic metrics don\'t capture
    the nuances of specialized applications like RAG systems.

5.  **Evolve your evaluation strategy**: As your LLM applications
    mature, your evaluation approach should evolve as well.

## What's Next?

As we continue refining our evaluation approach, we\'re exploring
several promising directions:

- **Behavioral testing**: Developing more sophisticated adversarial
  examples

- **Human-in-the-loop validation**: Selectively incorporating human
  feedback

- **Continuous learning**: Using evaluation failures as fine-tuning
  examples

- **Multi-modal evaluation**: Extending our framework to handle image
  and audio inputs

## Conclusion

The journey from Eval.ai to our current hybrid DeepEval-LangSmith
approach reflects the rapid evolution of LLM evaluation. By leveraging
DeepEval's synthetic data generation capabilities and LangSmith's
comprehensive observability, we've built an evaluation framework that
supports our TypeScript codebase while providing robust,
multi-dimensional quality assessment.

For teams building production LLM systems, we recommend exploring this
hybrid approach---it combines the best of specialized evaluation
techniques with practical integration into existing workflows and
technology stacks.

Remember: in the world of LLMs, you can't improve what you don't
measure, and you can't trust what you don't test.
