One of our primary process goals is to make frequent, small releases of our working software. We do this through regular communication and bi-weekly iterations on a product.

Communication helps our team achieve this goal by spreading knowledge, and creating a sense of a team, collaboration, and co-operation without the frequent releases would not be possible. Many times, solutions to problems emerge from within our team when we huddle to brainstorm together.

**How we do it?**

We talk. Daily. Multiple times daily.

While this might read like an obvious statement, there is often lots of room for improvement in reality. Many teams build walls between stakeholders when they would benefit from collaboration instead from product experts to engineering and design to marketing, finance, and potentially others. That collaboration starts with agreeing on what work should be done in which order and to what level of depth, and it never ends.

Be it our 15 min daily stand-ups, bi-weekly iteration planning meetings, or bi-weekly retrospectives, we make it a point to communicate often in a structured and unstructured environment. Stand-ups are mostly open where people are free to say what they need to, whereas a retrospective is a structured discussion aimed at getting the most information out of the data collected.

Few visible benefits we pass on to our client by communicating well inside and outside our teams:

1. Our clients save time by not having to fix the same problems repeatedly because our teams talk to each other in real-time daily. This practice also means the same kind of issues do not pop up from time to time as there is constant knowledge sharing and transfer happening, and if they do, they can be fixed faster.
2. Effective communication with all stakeholders helps us get quicker feedback, thus providing the opportunity to fine-tune our team's direction and the project as per the evolving requirements.
3. Familiarity in the team within the team and our clients ensures that all the stakeholders are always on the same page, and there is little left open to assumptions.
4. Our teams harness the individual's complementary skills, and effective communication ensures that there is knowledge transfer, and the whole group grows in multiple directions simultaneously.
