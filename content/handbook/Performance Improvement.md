# Performance Improvement

While we take pride in our culture of learning, frequent feedback, and individual mentorship, we recognize that sometimes, there may be a need to do more. We may face situations where an employee’s performance or behaviour is not aligned with our expectations, despite frequent feedback from their peers. Our process in such situations includes the following. At each step, we are fully committed to helping the employee improve, so that they no longer require the next step.

1. Recurring verbal feedback and guidance from the project lead
2. Written feedback from the project lead along with intimation to the employee that the same will be conveyed to the PST team 
3. Communication to the PST team if performance continues to be a concern
4. Peer reviews for the PST team to surface issues
5. An official Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) stating any recurring performance or behavioural issues, with action items that help solve these issues and specified timelines to achieve those goals
6. Continuous feedback and support during that time to help achieve listed goals
7. If during the PIP, we notice that the chances of improvement are slim, we stop billing the client, with full visibility of this fact to the employee
8. PIPs are often extended to give the employee a fair chance of achieving their goals
9. Potential outcomes of a PIP include status quo, additional learning paths, change in role, or (last resort) separation

While the overarching steps in the process are as listed above, the details of how long each step takes may vary depending on the employee’s situation. That said, it is a process that spans several months.

A few points to note. Incubyte will never disclose the fact that a peer of yours may be going through this process, other than to their project lead and the PST team. If you happen to be on this path, we assure that you will know of it upfront and will not be caught off-guard. You also have full discretion to talk to your peers about it, in any detail you want, if you wish to do so.
