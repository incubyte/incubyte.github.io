However, instead of the cheers and scientific breakthrough everyone expected, soon after the launch, the rocket started drifting northeast of its planned trajectory. Not responding to corrective measures, the rocket was finally ordered to self-destruct, just 5 minutes into its flight!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
