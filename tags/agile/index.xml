      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the need for an “Estimate”, because everything is bound to change rite in actuality.

The reason (IMHO) anything is this much discussed and written about is that the practices haven&amp;rsquo;t been carved in stone yet, are still in the evolving phase, and are in some way even disputed. There is so much going on in the Agile transformation initiatives that it&amp;rsquo;s possible the definition of agile development is different from company to company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
