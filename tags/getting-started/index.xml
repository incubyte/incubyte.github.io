      <description>&lt;p&gt;Employee onboarding is the important process of introducing newly hired employees to the organisation. It is everything that leads up to the employee&amp;rsquo;s total immersion into the organisation&amp;rsquo;s culture. An effective onboarding process helps the new employee relate better with the company values and helps them get up and running quicker. Immersion is the process of creating a common future and common purpose for all employees by aligning expectation, values, purpose, mission and goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
