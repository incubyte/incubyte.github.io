      <title>Code Tidying: The Story of a Backseat Driver</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s embark on a thought experiment. Envision yourself as a driving virtuoso, conquering city streets with gear shifts smoother than a buttered dolphin on a rainbow. Your turns rival a ninja&amp;rsquo;s wit, and parallel parking? You could slide a spacecraft into a closet unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog discusses different levels of productivity along with common pitfalls and different ways to optimize them. Recently I came across this blog by &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsletter.abinoda.com/p/four-lenses-of-productivity&#34;&gt;Abi Noda&lt;/a&gt;, written based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6_6&#34;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; by Amy J. Ko. It interestingly talks about productivity at Individual, Team, Organization, and Market levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Compounding Effect of Tidying Using CodeScene</title>
      <link>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/refactoring-to-tidying/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that most of a developer&amp;rsquo;s tasks end up being tactical activities, such as adding a text box here, adding a checkbox there, fixing a bug, or working with an outage. However, embodying the boy scout rule, one can always find small tidying opportunities that directly impact code quality and shift the developer’s work from tactical to strategic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is there a more economical and efficient alternative to Salesforce?</title>
      <link>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/salesforce-vs-in-house-custom-development/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing a direction when redefining your organization&amp;rsquo;s technical backbone is never easy. In this case study, we had the unique opportunity to observe the implementation of both - a Low-code/no-code CRM and tailored software solutions over two years. The outcome? When done right, tailored software solutions can bring more value to an organization, faster!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are you sabotaging your organizational goals?</title>
      <link>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/simple-sabotage/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/26184/pg26184-images.html&#34;&gt;Simple Sabotage Field Manual&lt;/a&gt;. What struck me was you do not need bombs and explosives to start sabotaging. Many small actions that can cause delays, untidiness, and losses are also sabotage attempts. Do you see any parallels between the excerpts of the white paper and organizational behavior where you work?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you a software developer? How can you be more effective on this journey of being a craftsperson?&#xA;A lot has been written on this subject, the most focus on the big picture.&#xA;But what about little things you can do to improve your daily work? All you need is 1% improvement to be on the trajectory of being a better developer and possibly a better human being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/&#34;&gt;Checklist Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; by Atul Gawande, walks us through the benefits of the humble checklist. He talks about how checklists of &amp;ldquo;dumb stuff&amp;rdquo; can save us from disasters in life and death situations. We developers, too, can use such a checklist when we start a new project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benefits and Challenges of Open-Source Development</title>
      <link>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/benefits-and-challenges-of-open-source-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/benefits-and-challenges-of-open-source-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open-source software (OSS) is the holy grail for developers. It is a hub of innovation through intense collaboration in this era of agile software development. Without it, many of the technologies we take for granted today would never have been developed or would have been locked away behind strict patents. The open-source movement is the reason technology has developed at such a breakneck pace over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever saw SonarQube laden with thousands of maintainability and security issues? Looking at those dashboards, we often believe we&amp;rsquo;re looking at the code&amp;rsquo;s state, but there is more to it. We are looking into how people work! We are looking into the team&amp;rsquo;s behaviour and how disciplined they are in writing code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Not All Tests are the Same</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On multiple occasions, I have worked on projects where I learned how critical testing is and that not all tests are the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do not Release Code Without Automated Tests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most projects that I see facing serious problems lack tests. You should write tests for two things&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do not Get so busy that you stop learning</title>
      <link>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/do-not-get-so-busy-that-you-stop-learning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning is the most vital part of a software developer&amp;rsquo;s life. Being so busy that one stops learning is neither desirable nor helpful to one&amp;rsquo;s career. Sandro wrote in his book Software Craftsman, having one year of experience ten times does not mean having ten years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do not Optimize Prematurely</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, you would think that the software development community has moved past this point, but I still get many teammates who want to &amp;ldquo;save memory&amp;rdquo; using HashMaps instead of POJOs. I am not too sure how efficient HashMaps are compared to POJOs, but I am sure of how they can become a maintenance nightmare if we start using maps wherever we could use POJO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do not Show Separate Estimate for Unit Testing</title>
      <link>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/do-not-show-separate-estimate-for-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/do-not-show-separate-estimate-for-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once I was asked in an interview (I was the interviewer!) What do you do in situations where the customers don&amp;rsquo;t want you to write test cases, or they want you to deprioritize the activity of writing test cases. My answer was, the customer gets such ideas if you show test cases as a separate activity; if testing becomes an inherent part of your development workflow, then one cannot tear them apart. This is where methodologies like TDD help. Delivering features mean delivering features with tests; they should not be two different things. Teams should not create stickies on boards or issues in Jira dedicated to unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do not Copy and paste code to minimize the impact:</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen code in your module, which was so complex that you decided to copy and paste it entirely rather than changing it to accommodate your requirement? What does it say about you and your codebase?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
