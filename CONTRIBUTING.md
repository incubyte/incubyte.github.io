## Writing Best Practices

- Write one sentence per line. [Read more](https://sive.rs/1s)
- Make sure to add a beginning and a conclusion.
- Try to talk about the problem before presenting the solution.
- Run your article through a spellchecker and/or [grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) for possible typos.
- Make sure your Markdown code is properly formatted, using a formatter like prettier is recommended.
- Run `hugo serve` after making changes to verify the changes on your local.

# Naming Conventions

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Prefixes

Use standard nouns as `prefix` to categorize the branch, e.g:

- article : The branch only includes blog related changes such as adding/editing an article
- feature : When a new feature is to be added such as dark mode to our website
- bugfix/hotfix : The purpose is to simple fix a bug that has sipped in

### Tips:

- The branch name should be short and able to convey the objective of the changes
- We'll follow the use of `/`(slash) delimiter between the category and branch motive
- Branch names should be hyphenated, they should be in `lower-kebab-case`
- For example, if the goal is to add a blog on ElasticSearch, the branch name can be — `article/why-elastic-search`

### What to avoid:

- Long names
- Only numerals
- Full sentences

These branches should be deleted as soon as the branch is merged to `main`.

## PR Naming Convention

- To keep a better track of blogs and filter them quickly, two things can be done:
- Add a prefix `Article: foo bar` to the title of the PR
- Add the label `article` to your PR

## Commit messages convention

- We'll follow category naming convention similar to what is explained for branches.

## Formatting

- GitHub actions pipeline is set to verify the formatting using `prettier` (a NodeJs library)
- Fix in the local by running (Beware!) `npx prettier --write .\content\blog\<filename>.md`
